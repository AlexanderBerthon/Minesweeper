# Minesweeper
This project is an attempt to replicate the game 'minesweeper'

There are 100 cells total and a subset of those cells contain a hidden bomb.

The goal of the game is to carefully clear each cell and find the bombs without triggering any. 

When all safe spaces are found, you win.

If any bomb is triggered, you lose.

Safe cells that are cleared will display hints if there is a bomb nearby, indicated by a number value 0-4. An empty cell represents no bombs adjacent to the cell while a 4 value means all 4 adjacent tiles are bombs. Use these hints to clear the board safely and flag all the bombs.

The game is currently limited to a 10x10 grid.
